# Introduction

For my individual project, I have decided to select a dataset containing the top 50 best selling video games of all time. I have had a high interest in video games for many years so I am interested to see if there is any correlations between the best selling games that I may be unaware about. 

# My Research Questions

1. Are there certain publishers that frequently make best selling video games?
2. What is the correlation between ranking and sales for the top 50 videog games?
3. Is there any correlation between game sales and how recently the game released?

# Dataset

My dataset comes from kaggle and is found in the data folder. The characteristics of the data set are as follows:

- Rank
- Title
- Sales
- Series
- Platform(s)
- Initial Release Date
- Developer(s)
- Publisher(s)

No moddification of the dataset is required.

# Methods

Tools:

- Numpy for numerical operations
- Pandas to load, clean, and analyze the dataset
- Matplotlib to create visualizations
