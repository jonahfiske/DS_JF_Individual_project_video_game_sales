# Introduction

For my individual project, I have decided to select a dataset containing the top 50 best selling video games of all time. I have had a high interest in video games for many years so I am interested to see if there is any correlations between the best selling games that I may be unaware about. 

# My Research Questions

1. Are there certain publishers that frequently make best selling video games?
2. Do games that are multiplatform perform better than games that only on a single platform?
3. Is there any correlation between game sales and how recently the game released?

# Dataset

My dataset comes from kaggle and is found in the data folder. The characteristics of the data set are as follows:

- Rank
- Title
- Sales
- Series
- Platform(s)
- Initial Release Date
- Developer(s)
- Publisher(s)

No moddification of the dataset is required.

# Methods

Tools:

- Numpy for numerical operations
- Pandas to load, clean, and analyze the dataset
- Matplotlib to create visualizations
