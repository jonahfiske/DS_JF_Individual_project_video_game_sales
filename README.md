# Introduction

For my individual project, I have decided to select a dataset containing the top 50 best selling video games of all time. I have had a high interest in video games for many years so I am interested to see if there is any correlations between the best selling games that I may be unaware about. 

# My Research Questions

1. Are there certain publishers that frequently make best selling video games?
2. What is the correlation between ranking and sales for the top 50 videog games?
3. Is there any correlation between game sales and how recently the game released?

# Dataset

My dataset comes from kaggle and is found in the data folder. The characteristics of the data set are as follows:

- Rank
- Title
- Sales
- Series
- Platform(s)
- Initial Release Date
- Developer(s)
- Publisher(s)
- Release Year*
  
*To properly get the code to work, I had to add an extra column to the dataset that specific the release year. Initial Release date has day, month, and year. I did not find release day or month relevant in my anaylsis.

# Methods

Tools:

- Numpy for numerical operations
- Pandas to load, clean, and analyze the dataset
- Matplotlib to create visualizations
- Scikit learn for linear regression

#Results

Question 1: Are there certain publishers that frequently make best selling video games?
